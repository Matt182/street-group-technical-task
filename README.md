# Matt Bowden | Street Group Technical Task

## Usage
Navigating to the root (/) you'll be presented with a simple form, use the file input to choose a .csv and click the
parse button to see the output.

## Time Breakdown
Once I got the repo and fresh install of Laravel setup, it took me about 20 mins to build the form and work out how to read the csv from the controller.

Another 1.5 hours was spent getting the logic in-place to be output.

Once I was happy with the general flow, 30 mins was spent fixing a few bugs and edge cases such as blank strings being inserted instead of null and trimming strings.

Finally, I went through and tidied up code, added comments etc

## Additional thoughts
I thought the task was a nice challenge, a few times I had to rewind and rethink logic but very happy with the overall result. I think it would have been nice to create a model for each person for felt this was out of scope.

I've never done anything quite like this so was interesting to lookup different built-in PHP methods for strings and arrays, seeing what would work.
